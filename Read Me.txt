Intent is for the user to run this script on your local machine to download a csv file from GCP and upload it to Pinterest.
You'll need to create your own config.txt using the config_template.txt file as an example.

The GCP_CREDENTIALS_JSON will need to be obtained from the GCP project/bucket the source files will be downloaded from.

To obtain a GCP Credential JSON file, a service account will need to be created.
Create a Service Account (if one doesn't already exist):
Go to the Google Cloud Console
Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
Create a new service account.
Assign it the appropriate roles (e.g., Storage Object Viewer or Storage Object Admin)

Generate a JSON Key:
After creating the service account, select the Keys tab.
Select Add Key > Create New Key
Select JSON and download.
This key should be placed as the LOCAL_DIRECTORY variable in the config.txt file.
The name of the key should be placed as the GCP_CREDENTIALS_JSON variable in the config.txt file.

The GCP_OBJECT_NAME variable in the config.txt file should be GCP directory the file to be download is located in and the filename itself.
For example, if you select the copy path icon in GCP for the path, it will be in the format:
bucket_name/directory1/directory2.../filename

Ex: Client_bucket/share/dir_a1/custom_audience_file.csv
So config.txt will have
GCP_BUCKET_NAME = Client_bucket
GCP_OBJECT_NAME = share/dir_a1/custom_audience_file.csv

Running the script will require logging into Pinterest website. This will include using the Okta login process.
Have your Okta application available to approve the sign in request.
There might come a time during login where Pinterest will prompt for a code to be entered. Often, this code will not be sent on the first attempt and you'll need to select the link to send the a code again.
